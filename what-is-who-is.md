I wrote the previous version (below the long line) in a very lazy manner and it was a very unsubstantial job. So, while I didn't search more, today morning I wrote a couple lines impromptu, that I think summarise, or get the essence of whatever I read about reasonably.

Here it is:
WHOIS is basically a directory (so-to-say) of information that people give when they register domain names. A reverse WHOIS let's one type in the domain and get the WHO IS information for that domain correct?

And the main application of WHO IS + it's reverse version being:
1. checking for attacks on one's sites (change in WHOIS information)
2. and I read about this, but exactly how it takes places I'm not sure -> people can attack the WHO IS server and that leads to the site getting hacked.

And third (going on a guess here)
the information retrieved by a Reverse WHO IS i.e. account/private information about the person/entity who owns the site could be used to exploit the person through all the media whose information is given e.g. email account, bank account etc. [although I'm quite sure the bank account details won't be available publicly in a reverse WHO IS]
---------------------------
**An Honest Note**
To be honest, I'm tired. I'll try and get the essence of this, but I'll be copy-pasting stuff while mentioning sources.

**What is it?**
To be honest I'm not exactly sure but here's what I know. 

Whenever one sign's up for a domain name etc. the person provide some private confidential information called 'whois records' which one should keep protected.

Getting these records is what comprises reverse-who-is and can be used to cause harm to the owner.

From what i've read, it heps one "Discover all domain names associated with an individual or an organization."

And the ICANN has been trying to get rid off it / come with an alternative that's more secretive and is a bit more private for domain registeres (not registrars).

**USES**
- You can tell if your site's hacked by looking at anomalies in your whois info
- Use Reverse WHOIS to uncover stuff about potential partners
"And if you wish to do this same kind of background check on all of your potential partners — which is highly advisable as the most recent Facebook breach showed — you can also subscribe to a regularly updated and accurate Reverse WHOIS API that you can easily integrate into your existing security infrastructure"

- "Cybersecurity analysts and researchers use reverse WHOIS reports to get more information regarding a spam or malware attack or any other kind of online intrusion or crime." - https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/blog/reverse-whois-in-action-find-all-domains-or-websites-of-a-company-and-more
